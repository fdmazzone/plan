    note = "\newline \textbf{Otras reseñas.} The MAA is delighted to be the publisher of the sixth edition of this book, updated with a new section 15.9 on the author's useful concept of inversive distance. Throughout most of this book, non-Euclidean geometries in spaces of two or three dimensions are treated as specializations of real projective geometry in terms of a simple set of axioms concerning points, lines, planes, incidence, order and continuity, with no mention of the measurement of distances or angles. This synthetic development is followed by the introduction of homogeneous coordinates, beginning with Von Staudt's idea of regarding points as entities that can be added or multiplied. Transformations that preserve incidence are called colineations. They lead in a natural way to elliptic isometries or congruent transformations. Following a recommendation by Bertrand Russell, continuity is described in terms of order. Elliptic and hyperbolic geometries are derived from real projective geometry by specializing an elliptic or hyperbolic polarity which transforms points into lines (in two dimensions) or planes (in three dimensions) and vice versa. This treatment can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with algebra up to the elements of group theory. - Publisher.

    \newline \textbf{Otras reseñas.} Polytopes are geometrical figures bounded by portions of lines, planes, or hyperplanes. In plane (two dimensional) geometry, they are known as polygons and comprise such figures as triangles, squares, pentagons, etc. In solid (three dimensional) geometry they are known as polyhedra and include such figures as tetrahedra (a type of pyramid), cubes, icosahedra, and many more; the possibilities, in fact, are infinite! H. S. M. Coxeter's book is the foremost book available on regular polyhedra, incorporating not only the ancient Greek work on the subject, but also the vast amount of information that has been accumulated on them since, especially in the last hundred years. The author, professor of Mathematics, University of Toronto, has contributed much valuable work himself on polytopes and is a well-known authority on them. Professor Coxeter begins with the fundamental concepts of plane and solid geometry and then moves on to multi-dimensionality. Among the many subjects covered are Euler's formula, rotation groups, star-polyhedra, truncation, forms, vectors, coordinates, kaleidoscopes, Petrie polygons, sections and projections, and star-polytopes. Each chapter ends with a historical summary showing when and how the information contained therein was discovered. Numerous figures and examples and the author's lucid explanations also help to make the text readily comprehensible. Although the study of polytopes does have some practical applications to mineralogy, architecture, linear programming, and other areas, most people enjoy contemplating these figures simply because their symmetrical shapes have an aesthetic appeal. But whatever the reasons, anyone with an elementary knowledge of geometry and trigonometry will find this one of the best source books available on this fascinating study.

        \newline \textbf{Otras reseñas.} This book is an introduction to the theory and applications of modern geometry  roughly speaking, geometry that was developed after Euclid. It covers three major areas of non-Euclidean geometry and their applica tions: spherical geometry (used in navigation and astronomy), projective geometry (used in art), and spacetime geometry (used in the Special The ory of Relativity). In addition it treats some of the more useful topics from Euclidean geometry, focusing on the use of Euclidean motions, and includes a chapter on conics and the orbits of planets. My aim in writing this book was to balance theory with applications. It seems to me that students of geometry, especially prospective mathe matics teachers, need to be aware of how geometry is used as well as how it is derived. Every topic in the book is motivated by an application and many additional applications are given in the exercises. This emphasis on applications is responsible for a somewhat nontraditional choice of top ics: I left out hyperbolic geometry, a traditional topic with practically no applications that are intelligible to undergraduates, and replaced it with the spacetime geometry of Special Relativity, a thoroughly non-Euclidean geometry with striking implications for our own physical universe. The book contains enough material for a one semester course in geometry at the sophomore-to-senior level, as well as many exercises, mostly of a non routine nature (the instructor may want to supplement them with routine exercises of his/her own).

It is designed to be used in an undergraduate course on geometry, and as such, its target audience is undergraduate math majors. However, much of it should be readable by anyone who is comfortable with the language of mathematical proof. Throughout, the goal is to develop the material patiently. One of the more appealing aspects of geometry is that it is a very visual subject. This book hopes to takes full advantage of that, with an extensive use of illustrations as guides.Geometry Illuminated is divided into four principal parts. Part 1 develops neutral geometry in the style of Hilbert, including a discussion of the construction of measure in that system, ultimately building up to the Saccheri-Legendre Theorem. Part 2 provides a glimpse of classical Euclidean geometry, with an emphasis on concurrence results, such as the nine-point circle. Part 3 studies transformations of the Euclidean plane, beginning with isometries and ending with inversion, with applications and a discussion of area in between. Part 4 is dedicated to the development of the Poincaré disk model, and the study of geometry within that model.While this material is traditional, Geometry Illuminated does bring together topics that are generally not found in a book at this level. Most notably, it explicitly computes parametric equations for the pseudosphere and its geodesics. It focuses less on the nature of axiomatic systems for geometry, but emphasizes rather the logical development of geometry within such a system. It also includes sections dealing with trilinear and barycentric coordinates, theorems that can be proved using inversion, and Euclidean and hyperbolic tilings.

Students are expected to read concurrently Books I-IV of Euclid's text, which must be obtained sepa rately. The remainder of the book is an exploration of questions that arise natu rally from this reading, together with their modern answers. To shore up the foundations we use Hilbert's axioms. The Cartesian plane over a field provides an analytic model of the theory, and conversely, we see that one can introduce coordinates into an abstract geometry. The theory of area is analyzed by cutting figures into triangles. The algebra of field extensions provides a method for deciding which geometrical constructions are possible. The investigation of the parallel postulate leads to the various non-Euclidean geometries. And in the last chapter we provide what is missing from Euclid's treatment of the five Platonic solids in Book XIII of the Elements. For a one-semester course such as I teach, Chapters 1 and 2 form the core material, which takes six to eight weeks.

    \newline \textbf{Otras reseñas.} Elementary geometry provides the foundation of modern geometry. For the most part, the standard introductions end at the formal Euclidean geometry of high school. Agricola and Friedrich revisit geometry, but from the higher viewpoint of university mathematics. Plane geometry is developed from its basic objects and their properties and then moves to conics and basic solids, including the Platonic solids and a proof of Euler's polytope formula. Particular care is taken to explain symmetry groups, including the description of ornaments and the classification of isometries by their number of fixed points. Complex numbers are introduced to provide an alternative, very elegant approach to plane geometry. The authors then treat spherical and hyperbolic geometries, with special emphasis on their basic geometric properties. This largely self-contained book provides a much deeper understanding of familiar topics, as well as an introduction to new topics that complete the picture of two-dimensional geometries. For undergraduate mathematics students the book will be an excellent introduction to an advanced point of view on geometry. For mathematics teachers it will be a valuable reference and a source book for topics for projects. The book contains over 100 figures and scores of exercises. It is suitable for a one-semester course in geometry for undergraduates, particularly for mathematics majors and future secondary school teachers.

    note = "\newline \textbf{Otras reseñas.} A lucid and masterly survey. — Mathematics GazetteProfessor Pedoe is widely known as a fine teacher and a fine geometer. His abilities in both areas are clearly evident in this self-contained, well-written, and lucid introduction to the scope and methods of elementary geometry. It covers the geometry usually included in undergraduate courses in mathematics, except for the theory of convex sets. Based on a course given by the author for several years at the University of Minnesota, the main purpose of the book is to increase geometrical, and therefore mathematical, understanding and to help students enjoy geometry.Among the topics discussed: the use of vectors and their products in work on Desargues' and Pappus' theorem and the nine-point circle; circles and coaxal systems; the representation of circles by points in three dimensions; mappings of the Euclidean plane, similitudes, isometries, mappings of the inversive plane, and Moebius transformations; projective geometry of the plane, space, and n dimensions; the projective generation of conics and quadrics; Moebius tetrahedra; the tetrahedral complex; the twisted cubic curve; the cubic surface; oriented circles; and introduction to algebraic geometry.In addition, three appendices deal with Euclidean definitions, postulates, and propositions; the Grassmann-Pluecker coordinates of lines in S3, and the group of circular transformations. Among the outstanding features of this book are its many worked examples and over 500 exercises to test geometrical understanding.

    note = "\newline \textbf{Otras reseñas.} The aim of this book is to throw light on various facets of geometry through development of four geometrical themes.The first theme is about the ellipse, the shape of the shadow cast by a circle. The next, a natural continuation of the first, is a study of all three types of conic sections, the ellipse, the parabola and the hyperbola.The third theme is about certain properties of geometrical figures related to the problem of finding the largest area that can be enclosed by a curve of given length. This problem is called the isoperimetric problem. In itself, this topic contains motivation for major parts of the curriculum in mathematics at college level and sets the stage for more advanced mathematical subjects such as functions of several variables and the calculus of variations.The emergence of non-Euclidean geometries in the beginning of the nineteenth century represents one of the dramatic episodes in the history of mathematics. In the last theme the non-Euclidean geometry in the Poincaré disc model of the hyperbolic plane is developed.

Also included is a chapter on infinite-dimensional generalizations of Euclidean and affine geometries. A uniform approach to different geometries, based on Klein's Erlangen Program is suggested, and similarities of various phenomena in all geometries are traced. An important notion of duality of geometric objects is highlighted throughout the book. The authors also include a detailed presentation of the theory of conics and quadrics, including the theory of conics for non-Euclidean geometries. The book contains many beautiful geometric facts and has plenty of problems, most of them with solutions, which nicely supplement the main text. With more than 150 figures illustrating the arguments, the book can be recommended as a textbook for undergraduate and graduate-level courses in geometry.

Starting with the well-known optical properties of conics, the authors move to less trivial results, both classical and contemporary. In particular, the chapter on projective properties of conics contains a detailed analysis of the polar correspondence, pencils of conics, and the Poncelet theorem. In the chapter on metric properties of conics the authors discuss, in particular, inscribed conics, normals to conics, and the Poncelet theorem for confoca.

    \newline{\textbf{Comentarios.} Geometría analítica.
    \newline \textbf{Otras reseñas.} This book, first published in 2004, is a genuine introduction to the geometry of lines and conics in the Euclidean plane. Lines and circles provide the starting point, with the classical invariants of general conics introduced at an early stage, yielding a broad subdivision into types, a prelude to the congruence classification. A recurring theme is the way in which lines intersect conics. From single lines one proceeds to parallel pencils, leading to midpoint loci, axes and asymptotic directions. Likewise, intersections with general pencils of lines lead to the central concepts of tangent, normal, pole and polar. The treatment is example based and self contained, assuming only a basic grounding in linear algebra. With numerous illustrations and several hundred worked examples and exercises, this book is ideal for use with undergraduate courses in mathematics, or for postgraduates in the engineering and physical sciences.
