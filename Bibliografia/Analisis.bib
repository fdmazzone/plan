It additionally develops the basics of control theory, which is a unique feature in current textbook literature.The following topics are particularly emphasised:• existence, uniqueness and continuation of solutions,• continuous dependence on initial data,• flows,• qualitative behaviour of solutions,• limit sets,• stability theory,• invariance principles,• introductory control theory,• feedback and stabilization.The last two items cover classical control theoretic material such as linear control theory and absolute stability of nonlinear feedback systems. It also includes an introduction to the more recent concept of input-to-state stability.Only a basic grounding in linear algebra and analysis is assumed. Ordinary Differential Equations will be suitable for final year undergraduate students of mathematics and appropriate for beginning postgraduates in mathematics and in mathematically oriented engineering and science.

The examples and exercises emphasize modeling not only in engineering and physics but also in applied mathematics and biology. There is an early introduction to numerical methods and, throughout, a strong emphasis on the qualitative viewpoint of dynamical systems. Bifurcations and analysis of parameter variation is a persistent theme. Presuming previous exposure to only two semesters of calculus, necessary linear algebra is developed as needed. The exposition is very clear and inviting. The book would serve well for use in a flipped-classroom pedagogical approach or for self-study for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student. This second edition of Noonburg's best-selling textbook includes two new chapters on partial differential equations, making the book usable for a two-semester sequence in differential equations. It includes exercises, examples, and extensive student projects taken from the current mathematical and scientific literature.

This book is intended as that guide. It is more conceptual than definitive and more light-hearted than pedagogic. It covers key topics and theoretical underpinnings that are necessary for the study of rich topics like nonlinear equations or stability theory. The author has included a great many illuminating examples and discussions that uncover the conceptual heart of the matter.

The book reviews the solution of elementary first-order differential equations, existence theorems, singular solutions, and linear equations of arbitrary order. It explains the solutions of linear equations with constant coefficients, operational calculus, and the solutions of linear differential equations. It also explores the techniques of computing for the solution of systems of linear differential equations, which is similar to the solutions of linear equations of arbitrary order. The text proves that if the coefficients of some differential equations possess certain restricted types of singularities, the solution will have Taylor series expansions about the singular points. The investigator can calculate a divergent series whose partial sums numerically approximate the solution for large x if the point in question is infinity, of which the series will be a Taylor series of negative powers of x. The book also explains the Fourier transform, its applications to partial differential equations, as well as the Hilbert space approach to partial differential equations. The book is a stimulating material for mathematicians, for professors, or for students of pure and applied mathematics, physics, or engineering.
